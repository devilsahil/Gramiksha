										<h3>What Noopur Jhadhav has to say..</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Gramisksha , it gave me a platform where I myself felt like a playmaker. Presented everything to the children in a way in which I always wanted to learn and enjoy my studies. Before executing the plan I was very much hesitant, but when it began it was like inhaling the first and freshest breeze of my own imaginative world. I handled class 2 students with another mentor Evita Das. We first updated ourselves about what they are being taught and what they KNOW. After that we started our teaching programs which comprised of explanation, demonstrations, activity works etc. I always used to get more enthusiastic on seeing the welcoming faces of children, and their responses kept me energetic during the sessions.

									   “Gramiksha” itself became my teacher and helped me explore my self too. It made me roobaroo with the conditions in  which students study. It made work and think way above my comfort zone and Voila! I surprised myself. I am and was very proud of my other mentors who were always brimming with new ideas. And now I am eagerly and desperately waiting for our next venture that shall be a  success again !”

										<h3>What Raghav Verma has to say..</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Gramiksha phase A was, for me, an experience of a life time. A few months ago, I had never imagined myself going to a village and doing something this grand. The whole trip has been a wakeup call for me. I have realised that the facilities available in these villages is far from satisfactory, things we take for granted are things they have to fight for.

Through the first phase of Gramiksha, we have laid down a strong foundation, on which we can build our dream. This was a good way to interact with my fellow members at Gramiksha and formed a very strong bond with them almost instantly. This certainly was the back bone of our success in the first phase.

All in all, I can proudly say that Gramiksha is the best thing that has ever happened to me.</p>

										<h2>About Us!</h2>
										<br></br><b><u>Know Something About Us</u></b>
									</header>
									<p>
										Gramiksha is an inventiveness that endeavors for a comprehensive society which provides equal opportunity for all by enhancing the quality of education and co-scholastic activities. Our aspiration is to endorse education and culture among the poverty-ridden and ignorant zone in India.
Gramiksha is a non-governmental organization , registered under MP Society Act, 1973 ,  that works in the fields of community development, child welfare, education and literature. It operates in India (Gwalior, Indore, Bhopal, Delhi, Bangalore, and Jaipur). It was founded on 30th August 2011.
Our work is to create interest among students for education. We donate books, install medical facilities, make the school’s environment hygienic and also organize activities and workshops. Our team is composed of students and graduates from schools and universities, and quite a lot of young working people. We don’t promise to make the entire India literate (or maybe deep down, we do) and change the circle of education, but we do promise to make a difference in Indian literacy rate and hopefully, it will do wonders for us.

											<br></br><b><u>Why We Do It</u></b>
										</header>
										<p>
											We started as a small group trying to help few kids, and then we could see the effect of it on both – the people we were trying to help and ourselves. Believe us when we say that it feels good. We do not want to mention the sad statistics of Indian literacy to provoke you to join us. We want you to feel for the children around you – ragpickers and street kids begging. We want you to feel for the health issues our country is facing. We want you to do your bit as a young citizen of this country. 
											That is why we do it.

										</header>
										<p>
											Be a volunteer at Gramiksha. If you have time or aptitude, share with us. You do not require any special recommendation or experience to be a volunteer. Our volunteers include school, college students, housewives, teachers, professionals.
											Make a friend who is underprivileged.- If you know a person in your vicinity, among your servants, friends or relatives, extend your friendship. You can visit them, go out with them would make them feel acknowledged.
											Donate old books, computers etc that may be useful in a student's life in any form. This could grant employment to the disadvantaged.
											Sponsor a child’s education
											Donate in cash or kind.
